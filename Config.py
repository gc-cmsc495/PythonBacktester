# Description:
# The user will execute the program via the command line with three arguments:
# a start date, end date and the path to a text configuration file. The purpose of 
# the config file to so that back-tests (experiments) can be reproduced simply
# by providing the same config.

# The Config class will parse the command line arguments and also the
# configuration file. See example.ini for an example configuration file.
