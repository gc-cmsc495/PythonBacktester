# Description:
#
# The report class will be responsible for taking results from the Analysis Class
# and other classes and output the results in a well formatted text file.
#
# We must carefully consider the format in which the results are published so they
# can be easily processed by other programs or utilities (e.g. Strategy Comparison Tools, GUIs, etc.).
# 

# Class Author: TBD
